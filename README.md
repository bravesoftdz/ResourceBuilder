# ResourceBuilder
Delphi based tool for producing resources (FONT AWESOME based)

http://fontawesome.io

parse data from https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/master/less/variables.less


install the FontAwesome true type font.
if there are newer icons that you're not seeing, update the fa_lookups.ini file (and share back here!)

This is crude v0.1 bt it's helpful for making .PNG and .BMP resources at different sizes (transparent PNGs are good!)
It was also adapted to produce .RES/.RC files, and at some point I'll glue that code back in too.


##to-do  
update fa-lookups from 4.5 to current (4.7 - and 5.0 is on the way!)
